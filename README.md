# Exploratory Data Analysis and Predictive Modelling on Categorical Dataset – Statistical Data Mining Project Spring 2017
• Analyzed and cleaned a Mushroom dataset with 22 variables and around 8,000 categorical observations.
• Explored the baseline accuracy of dataset in R and built visualizations in R and Tableau to understand the patterns.
• Built probabilistic and classification predictive models like Naïve Bayes with Cross Validation, Recursive Partitioning and Random Forest in R to understand the accuracy of predictions through confusion matrix.
• Executed the models on several subsets of data by imputing missing values and shuffling the train and test data partitioning
